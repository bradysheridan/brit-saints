Among them is the venerable friend of God [al-wālīya al-jalīla], the mad fool [al-majdhūba al-bahlūla], rapturous in the Majestic [al-Jalāl] and overwhelmed in the Beauty [al-Jamāl], blessed [by God] in the special and the general, a destination [al-maqsūda] to perform ziyāra for all of humankind: al-Sayyida Āmīna. Known as “Mināna al-Bistīyūnīyya,” she is from the band of people from Fez known as “the children of al-Bistīyūn.”

She was among the righteous hidden women [al-sāliḥāt al-ghā’ibāt], always [in a state of] concealment [al-ghayba], abstaining constraint [sāqita al-taklīf], constantly speaking in signs and expressions, [….], for they were always as she recounted. She was a meeting place for the common people and the elite, the scholars and the rulers, they gathered with her [ya‘aqadūn bihi] and sought blessing [yatabarakūn bihi] from her. And she possessed a beard like that of a man’s. Her speech with whomever came to her side was: “Where have you been? Where did you come from? And, to where are you going?” One of the gnostics [ba‘aḍ al-‘ārifīn] has said [concerning her]: “Verily, she says so and so!” He continued, explaining: “Indeed, it is beautiful speech, by it, she means: You are in nothing, you come from nothing, and you are going to nothing, your mother is the earth.” “From the it [the earth] we have created you and into it we shall return you, and from it we will bring you out once again.” [Q20:55].

Her dress was always a green tunic and nothing else, and the people came to her every day and every hour, men and women. She would indicate to each one of them their spit, and some of them would understand her meaning and some of them would not understand until occurred what occurred. Sometimes, moodiness would overtake her so that she would not speak with anyone except with abuse and repulsive prayer, repulsing the people from her, and slamming the door in their faces.

She was listed by Shaykh al-Tawūdī in his Fihrist concerning those he had met of the righteous folk in Morocco: “Among them is al-Sayyida Mināna Bistīyūnīyya. She was buried by her house opposite the Samārīn Mosque of Fās al-Qarawiyyīn, which is now known as the mosque al-Bistīyūnīyya, in front of Fundiq al-Malliḥ in the Rasīf Market.” He continued: “I visited and spoke with her in 1161 hijrī while the city was besieged. Accompanying me was al-Qādī Abū Muḥammad ‘Abd al-Qādir Būkhrīṣ. She foretold the cessation of the siege and instructed me to go on Ḥaj. Twenty years passed between her speech and my pilgrimage. She passed away in the year 1164 hijrī/1751 miladī.`,

She was—may God have mercy on her in what is said—an ascetic servant [‘ābida zāhida] the aforementioned indicated by righteousness [ṣalāḥ], as well as goodness [khayr], blessing [baraka], and success [nijāḥ]. It is narrated about her that she would leave the house at night with her daughters to perform ziyāra at the Idrīsī shrine, and when she passed by a ḥānūt which is still there today, she would say: “Look [all of you] at this house which my lord gave to me.” When she died, they buried her by the ḥānūt for it was counted among her miracles.

I do not know now about her biography nor her death, except that it—and God knows best—was in the middle of the second century after the millennium. She was alive in the entire month of Rajab [7th month] of the year 1120 hijrī [1708 miladī]. Her tomb is by the ḥānūt near the Idrīsī shrine, and it is the meeting place for Dār al-Qayṭūn.

People continue to seek blessings from her even today, except that they call her by the name of “Lalla Kanza,” as some among the ignorant common people and women who are not told history nor genealogy mistakenly believe that she is al-Sayyida Kanza, mother of our saint Idrīs of the Banī Fez. Yet, what I learned from some of the honorable among her relatives who were more knowledgeable of her accounts and who tended her tomb [taṣarraf] is that her name is Zaynab and that she is the daughter of Mūlāy Idrīs, son of Mūlāy ‘Alī, as we mentioned previously. [I also learned] that her husband is the favored sharīf [al-sharīf al-fāḍil], Mūlāy ‘Abd Allah, son of Mūlāy Āḥmad al-Ḥasanī al-Idrīsī al-Jawṭī, from her lineage. He [ one of the ahl al-tasrīf/relatives] also informed me of [rasūm] by his hand comprising of something among her affairs and what it concerns from authorization by her husband, and other things—only God knows best.`,

    "content": `She was—may God have mercy on her—among the righteous [al-ṣāliḥāt] and the Gnostics [knowers of God] [al-‘ārifāt], great in devotion to [duty toward, birūr] her husband, carrying out his affairs and interests. Because of this [her actions and devotion to her husband], she received from the favor/grace [fāḍil] of God the Almighty [al-‘Aẓīm] what she received. She was among the people of the step [ahl al-khatwa] and flying in the air [ṭayarān al-hawā’] and progressed in different stages, a contemporary of the Shaykh al-Wālī al-Ṣāliḥ, Sīdī Ibrahīm al-Zawārī. She was buried outside Bāb al-Gisa in this city having died in the year 961 hijrī [1553-1554 miladī]. When the aforementioned shaykh, Sīdī Ibrahīm came to Morocco from Tunis to perform ziyāra at the tomb of Shaykh Abī al-‘Abās as-Sabtī [died 600-601 hijrī/1204 miladī], he became sick on the way before arriving in the open country [falā min al-ārḍi]. On the way, the owner of this biography came to him, breaking the custom of Fez, and she provided what he was in need of. So he said to her one day: “Who are you?” She replied: “I am from the alley of Ḥijāma in Fez, and my name is Fāṭima!” Entry 144 mentions some of this.

    As specified in the Mir’ā, “I heard from more than one person that the Shaykh Sīdī Ibrahīm al-Zawārī was traveling and he fell very ill in a desert, obliging him to stay in a lonely place. Until, he saw a dove/pigeon flying until it grew close to him. It descended and when it did, it was a woman carrying a meal made of leavened wheat known as harira. She remained with him until he was recovered from his illness. So, he said to her: ‘I asked you, by God, who are you?’ She replied to him: ‘My name is Fāṭima, daughter of so-and-so (I named him and forgot him).’  She continued: ‘I am from Fez, so if you come to it, ask in Ḥijāma alley about the house of so-and-so—you will find me there!’

    “When Sīdī Ibrahīm entered Morocco and arrived in Fez, he asked about the house and so found it. He knocked on the door and she exited it and graciously welcomed him. He resided as a guest at her side. A man came to him in states of intoxication [aḥwāl al-sukr], staining [his] clothes with fig. So, she met him and washed his legs and cleaned his clothes, and made comfortable his bed, and made feasible [fa‘alat al-mustaṭā‘] his devotion. The shaykh Abū Sālim resided in their hospitality three days, and he contemplated her states in her practice and worship, for he saw her in her dress [implied without ḥijāb], as was the custom of women and in her worship. She did not exceed the good performance [iḥsān ādā’] of her religious duties and what pertains to them. He [Shaykh Abū Sālim] was pleased by that and asked her about what she received by these actions [from God]. She responded to him: ‘By doing the right of God the Almighty in what he orders of the right of the husband!’”

    I saw several mentions [in other [texts] not restricted/limited?], and by the handwriting of some of the virtuous, that she was buried by the alley of Hijāma in a lane leading from the door of al-Madrasa al-Ṣabāhiyya in the entrance door. But, I asked the people of this alley along with the owners of the aforementioned house: “Do they know of a tomb by it or have they heard of it?” They responded to me, all of them: “No!”

    She is also mentioned in the “Rawḍ” in the biography of the aforementioned Sīdī Ibrahīm, and it did not mention her burial place and there is no mention of her in the “Tanbīh” nor by al-Shaykh al-Mudar‘a. God only knows.`,

Her biography is in al-Maqsid, and it did not mention in it the dater of her death, but it did mention that she was buried by the garden at the entrance to Bāb al-Gīsa [Bab al-Guissa], meaning with her husband who was mentioned. God only knows.`,

She was—may God have mercy on her—a righteous devotee of God [ṣāliḥa qānita] who possessed reason [‘aql], ascetism [zuhd], and religion [dīn] as well as modesty [hayba], tranquility, [sakīna], dignity [waqār], and gentleness [līn]. She had some among the women followers who served and accompanied her. She was prolific in dhikr and circumspect in speech; she always had her large rosary of a thousand beads on a plate in her hands, never separating from it in sickness or health. If women would gather at her side and chatter, she would order them to leave her.

She would indicate with signs [ishārāt]what would befall in the future, and all that she indicated was. She would always recite the Ḥizb al-Falāj of al-Jazūlī after the maghrib prayer, and after it, would perform the dhikr of our Mūlāy ‘Abd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī, and after it the prayer of our Mūlāy ‘Abd al-Sallām Ibn Mushīsh. After the morning prayer, she would recite the Ḥizb al-Falāj (mentioned above) every day, and after it, al-Musbi‘āt al-‘Ashr, and the Ḥizb al-Kabīr of al-Shādhilī, and would conclude with the Hallilah [la ilaha illaallah], and the singular name [of God] [al-ism al-mufrad], as it is in the zāwīya of her grandfather. She would not refrain from reciting in sickness nor in health nor in any place [maḥall—state?] she was in.

She passed away—may God have mercy upon her, at the beginning of the sacred Ḥaj, which was completed in the year 1139 hijrī--the year of Sulṭān Mūlāy Ismā‘īl’s death—on the 29th of Rajab.

She was called such because she used to make prayer mats [al-lubbūd] before her [state] of ecstasy. When the state [of attraction] overpowered her, she began going out to the public markets, babbling imprudently.

Then she departed Fez [al-Bali] and resided by the towers outside of Bab al-Fatūḥ with the highest seat of madness. She remained there for approximately 2 years, rain or shine. Then she returned to the old city and so wandered absently in the markets, muttering with a meaning only she could understand. Her state weakened and she would uncover parts of her body with no concern for her action.

After some time, she traveled to the side of Shaykh Sidi Ahmad al-Barnisi in Lamṭa (city in Tunisia) and remained near him for around a year. She then returned to Fez with dogs which encircled her as she walked. She spoke only with hidden meanings and signs and ceased her foolish babbling. All of what she indicated occurred, both near and far. She used to stand by the door of the mosques during Friday prayer and shout: “Oh scholars! Oh oppressors!” She would also stand by the door of Qarawiyyīn, yelling: “I thought he came from Sūs, but actually, he is between the columns obtuse [madsūs]! At that time, the sulṭan, our lord Mulāy Sulaymān was studying at Qarawiyyīn. Thus, with her speech, she indicated what Mulāy Sulaymān would be like as a ruler.

She would occasionally occupy herself some nights while people slept, distinguishing herself from them through her performances of raka’at [bowing], prayers, invocations, and supplications. Her situation and miracles were well-known among the people. She was also among those whom the shaykh Sidi al-Tāwadī ibn Sawda al-Mirī met and bestowed baraka on.

She died, may God have mercy upon her, in the beginning of the year 1199 hijrī. It is said in the book, “Sulūk al-Tariq al-Ḥāliya” [The Wayfarers of the Path]: She is buried by the al-Ja‘āydī garden, near Shaykh Sidi Abu Ghālib al-Ṣāraywī.

She was, may God have mercy on her, beautiful of character [ḥasana al-khulq], soft of tongue [layina al-kilām], and good of companionship [ḥasana al-‘ishra], especially with her husband, never getting angry with him, never confronting him, and never distancing herself from him ever. She was among the humble [al-khāshi‘āt], the nourishing [al-qā’itāt], the abstinent [al-ṣā’imāt], and the enduring [al-ṣābirāt].

Her mother and four of her sisters died as did her three of her sons and her daughter and their children, yet she did not weep aloud for any of them, nor become embittered at their death, nor beat her chest in sorrow. She only cried lightly with tears, nothing else.

She would frequently perform dhikr [invoke God’s name], diligently reciting the litanies [al-āḥzāb] mourning and night, and visit the righteous folk, loving the people of good virtue [ahl al-khayr al-muntasbīn]. She would often perform supererogatory duties and prayers at night and would attend the recitation/lecture [majlis] of al-Bukhārī by Abī al-‘Abās Ibn Mubārak by the tomb of Sīdī Āhmad al-Yahya after the morning prayer then after him, then after, she would attend the majlis of Abī ‘Abd Allah Jasūs until she passed away.

Until her last years, she was persistent in her wuḍū’, never residing without it ever. She was diligent in performing communal prayer every time, either in Qarawiyyīn or at the shrine of Mūlāy Idrīs.

Her son Sīdī Muḥammad recorded her biography in his composition, “Sulūk al-Ṭarīq al-Wārīyya,” and he said at the end of her biography [but not his text]: “She died in the year 1177 hijrī/1763 miladī, and she was buried with our Sīdī al-Wālid in the seat of paradise [bi-matraḥ il-jannati].” She had—may God have mercy on her—four children with her husband; all of them were good [ākhyār] and blessed [mubārakūna] with the best among them being Sīdī ‘Abd al-Jayd.`,

Among them is his [Shaykh Abī Hassan ‘Alī al-Sanhājī] servant and his companion, the magnificent friend of God [al-walīya al-Jalīla], the high-ranking diligent woman [al-‘alīya al-qadr al-ḥafīla]: al-Sayyīda Āmina, daughter of the faqīh, al-Qāḍī Abī al-‘Abbās Āḥmad ibn ‘Alī ibn ‘Abd al-Raḥmān ibn al-‘Āfīyya al-Miknāsī. The biography of her father is presented after that of his shaykh, Ibn Ghāzī, he is buried a[الكغّادين] are buried [min dākhil hadha khārij]--it has been told to us that his death was in the year 955 hijrī/1548 miladī.

She was—may God have mercy upon her—among the greatest of the friends of God [kibār al-awliyā’] and special of the sincere ones [khāṣa al-aṣfīyā’]. She took from the shaykh Abī al-Ḥassan ‘Alī al-Ṣanāhjī and was his servant and follower. She never separated herself from a vessel of oil. When the shaykh would come to her, he would take the vessel of oil over her and pour it over himself because he used to love that. Her family hated her service to the shaykh, so he would say: “Verily: The children of Ibn al-Qāḍī, all of them, don’t come from the city of Meknes to Fez except to remove her!” Her family imprisoned her one time in a room and put an iron chain on her. All of a sudden, they felt him standing in the middle of the house calling out: “Ya Āmina!” When he called her, she replied: “Yes, ya Sīdī!” He responded to her: “Come to me!” At that moment, the shackles fell from her legs and she left the room, which was still locked, and went to him while her family was watching. So, from this time, her family submitted to both of them and their state.

One day, her family made chicken and distributed the meal according to each family member. So she said, “If the [female] dog of my master was here—for he had a dog—I would give a portion of this to her!” For, when the dog was with her and she had a substance in her hand, she would always give a portion of it to her.

She was among the people of the steps [ahl al-khatwa] and she would sometimes [rubama—perhaps/maybe] cry out in her bed wounded or something like that from the effect of presence in the struggle [al-jihad, against her self]. The shaykh, Sīdī ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān al-Majdhūb—may God be pleased with him, witnessed her [in this struggle] especially, and verily he would say: “Sīdī [shaykh Abī al-Ḥassan ‘Alī al-Ṣanāhjī] died, so I and my sister Āmina inherited from him, “for the male, the equivalent of two females” [Q4:11]. When she died, he said: “Now, I have obtained the inheritance of my father, all of it.” Meaning: he inherited from her what remained of the secret knowledge [sir] of his shaykh.

She was married to the son of her paternal uncle: the virtuous [al-fādịil] and the good [al-khayr], Abū Zakarīyā’ Yahya ibn Qāsim ibn ‘Alī Ibn Abī al-‘Āffiya al-Miknāsī. Her marriage contract took place on the 5th of Shawwāl 911 hijrī [Saturday, March 10th, 911]. When death attended her, she left who was with her in room and said to them: “Indeed, my master [Sīdī Shaykh Abī al-Ḥassan ‘Alī al—Ṣanhājī] is coming to attend my spirit’s departure!” Then, she died.

He death was—in what is said—within the year 960 hijrī [1553-1554 miladī]. It is said in al-Ibtihāj that: “She died after her father around 77-78 years old.” It says also: “Her birth was around 885 and her death was in the year 963. God knows best.” Her tomb is by the garden of her shaykh Abī al-Ḥassan al-Ṣanhājī, behind its back. This is recorded in “Taḥfa ahl al-Sadīqīn” and in other books.`,
