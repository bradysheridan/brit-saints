  *Full text:*


  Among them is a blessed and honorable woman whose name is Lalla Zaynab, daughter of the honorable sayyid, the well-known and exalted Mūlāy Idrīs Ibn Mūlāy Abī al-Ḥasan ‘Alī al-Ḥasanī al-Idrīsī al-Jawṭī al-‘Amrānī al-Tūnisī, who is buried in the happy shrine previously mentioned \[ v1: 14].


  She was—may God have mercy on her—an ascetic servant, which is indicated by her righteousness, as well as her goodness, blessing, and success. At night, she would leave the house with her female cousins to perform ziyāra at the Idrīsī shrine. One time, she was passing by a small shop—where she is currently buried—and she said: “Look at this house which my lord gave to me!” When she died, they buried her by the shop, as it was considered among her miracles.


  I do not know now about her biography nor her death, except that it—and God knows best—was in the middle of the second century after the millennium. She was alive during the entire month of Rajab of the year 1120 hijrī \[1708 miladī]. Her tomb is by the small shop near the Idrīsī shrine, and it is the meeting place for Dār al-Qayṭūn.


  People continue to seek blessings from her even today. However, they call her by the name of “Lalla Kanza,” as some among the ignorant common people and women who are not told history nor genealogy mistakenly believe that she is al-Sayyida Kanza, mother of our saint Idrīs of the Banī Fez. Yet, I learned from one of her honorable relatives who was more knowledgeable of her accounts and who tended her shrine [*ḍarīḥ*] that her name is Zaynab and that she is the daughter of Mūlāy Idrīs, son of Mūlāy ‘Alī, as we mentioned previously. I also learned that her husband was the favored sharīf, Mūlāy ‘Abd Allah, son of Mūlāy Āḥmad al-Ḥasanī al-Idrīsī al-Jawṭī, also from her lineage. The relative who tended her tomb also informed me of documents he had written containing some information about her and her husband’s affairs—only God knows best.
