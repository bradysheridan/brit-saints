‘ābida zāhida; ṣalāḥ; khayr; baraka, najāḥ

*Full text:*

Among them is a blessed and honorable woman whose name is Lalla Zaynab, daughter of the honorable sayyid, the well-known and exalted Mūlāy Idrīs Ibn Mūlāy Abī al-Ḥasan ‘Alī al-Ḥasanī al-Idrīsī al-Jawṭī al-‘Amrānī al-Tūnisī, who is buried in the happy shrine previously mentioned [ v1: 14].

She was—may God have mercy on her—an ascetic servant, which is indicated by her righteousness, as well as her goodness, blessing, and success. At night, she would leave the house with her female cousins to perform ziyāra at the Idrīsī shrine. One time, she was passing by a small shop—where she is currently buried—and she said: “Look at this house which my lord gave to me!” When she died, they buried her by the shop, as it was considered among her miracles.

I do not know now about her biography nor her death, except that it—and God knows best—was in the middle of the second century after the millennium. She was alive during the entire month of Rajab of the year 1120 hijrī [1708 miladī]. Her tomb is by the small shop near the Idrīsī shrine, and it is the meeting place for Dār al-Qayṭūn.

People continue to seek blessings from her even today. However, they call her by the name of “Lalla Kanza,” as some among the ignorant common people and women who are not told history nor genealogy mistakenly believe that she is al-Sayyida Kanza, mother of our saint Idrīs of the Banī Fez. Yet, I learned from one of her honorable relatives who was more knowledgeable of her accounts and who tended her shrine [*ḍarīḥ*] that her name is Zaynab and that she is the daughter of Mūlāy Idrīs, son of Mūlāy ‘Alī, as we mentioned previously. I also learned that her husband was the favored sharīf, Mūlāy ‘Abd Allah, son of Mūlāy Āḥmad al-Ḥasanī al-Idrīsī al-Jawṭī, also from her lineage. The relative who tended her tomb also informed me of documents he had written containing some information about her and her husband’s affairs—only God knows best.`,

good [*khayra*]; pleasing [*uriḍiya*]; noble [*ḥasībiya*]; virtuous [*zakīyya*]; dignified of morals, beautiful of companions; pleasant of association [*al-mu‘āshara*];

*Full biography:*

Among them are: His wife, mother to his son Sīdī Maḥmud: al-Sayyida Fāṭima, daughter of ‘Abd al-Mūlay al-‘Uthmānī.

She was—may God have mery on her—good [*khayra*], pleasing [*muriḍiya*], noble [*ḥasībiya*]*,* and virtuous [*zakīyya*], dignified of morals, beautiful of companions, and pleasant of association [*al-mu‘āshara*]. She never rewarded an ill offense with an ill offense, but rather, was gracious, forgiving and expressing patience toward any injury or ignorance against her.

*Al-Maqsid* states: “Her husband and her were among the people of devotedness and faithfulness, of noble and high status, and among those who gain the favor of God, glory be to him, and attain his mercy and satisfaction.” The author of *al-Maqṣid* continued: “Their son, Shaykh Sīdī Maḥmud—may God be pleased with him--related that when he visited the Qutb, our Mūlāy ‘Abd al-Salām ibn Mashīsh (d. 1227 m)—may God benefit us through him--that he saw Sīdī ‘Abd al-Salām—may God be pleased with him. The people of God were gathered around the great shaykh, and Sīdī Maḥmud saw his father and his mother among them. When he saw this, he said to his companions: ‘The people of God, including my parents, are looking at you, yet you do not see them!’” [It is also] stated in *al-Maqsid*: “This vision was a sign of their blessing, and that of their son, may God be please with him and with them both.”

Her biography is in *al-Maqṣid* which did not mention the dater of her death, but it did note that she was buried by the cemetary of Bāb al-Gisa [Bab al-Guissa], near the entrance  to Bāb al-Gīsa [Bab al-Guissa], meaning with her husband. God only knows.`,

Died 1139 hijrī/1711-12 miladī

Among them is the sister of great scholar, Sīdī Maḥmud ibn ‘Abd al-Raḥman al-Fāsī al-Fihrī [v. 1, 322], the invalid [*al-musna al-muq‘ada*], the righteous woman guided by baraka [*al-ṣāliḥa al-baraka al-musddada*], al-Sayyīda Āmina, daughter of Sīdī ‘Abd al-Raḥman al-Qādir al-Fāsī.

She was—may God have mercy on her—a righteous devotee of God [*ṣāliḥa qānita*] who possessed reason [*‘aql*], ascetism [*zuhd*], and religion [*dīn*] as well as modesty [*hayba*], tranquility, [*sakīna*], dignity [*waqār*], and gentleness [l*īn*]. She had some women followers who served and accompanied her. She was prolific in dhikr and circumspect in speech; she always had her large rosary of a thousand beads on a plate in her hands, never separating from it in sickness or health. If women would gather at her side and chatter, she would order them to leave her.

She would indicate with signs what would befall in the future, and all that she indicated occurred. She would always recite the Ḥizb al-Falāh of al-Jazūlī after the maghrib prayer, and after it, would perform the dhikr of Mūlāy ‘Abd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī, and after it the prayer of Mūlāy ‘Abd al-Salām Ibn Mashīsh. After the morning prayer, she would recite the Ḥizb al-Falāh every day, and after it, *al-Musbi‘āt al-‘Ashr* and the Ḥizb al-Kabīr of al-Shādhilī, and would conclude with the *Haylalah* [*la ilaha illaallah*], and the singular name [Allah], following the path of her grandfather’s zāwīya. She would not refrain from reciting in sickness nor in health nor in any place she was in.

She passed away (may God have mercy upon her), at the beginning of the Ḥajj, which was completed in the year 1139 hijrī--the year of Sulṭān Mūlāy Ismā‘īl’s death—on the 29th of Rajab (Mar 21, 1727 m). She was buried by the zāwīya of her grandfather, at Bāb al-Nāfidha by the grave of Sīdī al-Hājj al-‘Sha‘īr, on the right of the miḥrāb.`,

righteous woman [*ṣāliḥa*];  the successful friend of God [*walīya*], the wayfaring madwoman [*al-majdhuba al-sālika*]

*Full text*

Among them is the righteous woman [*ṣāliḥa*], the successful friend of God [*walīya*], the wayfaring madwoman [*al-majdhuba al-sālika*] for whom [the state of] attraction ruled, al-sayyida Safiya Labbāda. She was called such because she used to make prayer mats before her enrapturement. When the state of enraptured attraction overpowered her, she began going out to the public markets, babbling imprudently.

Then she departed Fez al-Bali and resided by the towers outside of Bab al-Fatūḥ, near the upper side of the cemetary. She remained there for approximately 2 years, rain or shine. Then she returned to the old city, wandering absently in the markets, muttering with a meaning only she could understand. As her state weakened, she began uncovering parts of her body with no concern for her acts.

After some time, she traveled to the side of Shaykh Sidi Ahmad al-Barnisi in Lamṭa and remained near him for about a year. She then returned to Fez, encircled by dogs as she walked. She spoke only with hidden meanings and signs and ceased her foolish babbling. All of what she indicated occurred, both near and far. She used to stand by the door of the mosques during Friday prayer and shout: “Oh scholars! Oh oppressors!” She would also stand by the door of Qarawiyyīn, yelling: “I thought he came from Sūs, but actually, he is between the columns obtuse [*madsūs*]! At that time, the sultan, our lord Mulāy Sulaymān was studying at Qarawiyyīn. With this speech, she indicated what Mulāy Sulaymān would be like as a ruler.

She would occasionally occupy herself some nights while people slept, distinguishing herself from them through her performances of raka’at [bowing], prayers, invocations, and supplications. Her situation and miracles were well-known among the people. She was also among those whom the shaykh Sidi al-Tāwadī ibn Sawda al-Mirī met and bestowed baraka on.

She died, may God have mercy upon her, in the beginning of the year 1199 hijrī. It is said in the book *Sulūk al-Ṭarīqa al-Ḥāliya* [The Wayfarers of the Path]: “She is buried by the al-Ja‘āydī cemetery, near Shaykh Sidi Abu Ghālib al-Ṣāraywī. She had a wonderful funeral.” Her tomb is now unknown.`,
