{`*Maps are not territory; they are spaces, spaces to be crossed and recrossed and experienced from every angle. The only to understand a map is to get down into it, to play at the edges, to jump into the center and back out again.” (Pinto 2016)*

*“What persists is what was recently defined as an ‘archaeology of the disappeared’: material traces or (immaterial traces...) that allow us to recreate a sacred space that defines the territories in which they are found.” (Aillet and Tuil Leonetti 2015; El Hour 2022)*

When not mapping, she writes about [Sufism, gender, and sexuality in North Africa](https://brill.com/view/journals/jie/4/1-2/article-p128_7.xml?language=en), the figuring of madness, and the ethics of bewilderment.
